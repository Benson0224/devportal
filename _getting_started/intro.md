## Learn the basics
Steem has a much richer ecosystem than most blockchains. If you're new to Steem you should start by [learning basic 
Steem concepts todo:LINK](http://www.sens.org). Blockchain veterans will have an easy time with this section, but should still 
take some time, as Steem _does_ have unique features.

## Connect with Developers
Steem started as a social blockchain, and we carry that legacy into our developer community, which has continued to be 
very interested and active. A great place to start is our [Community & Help](/resources/#resources-developeradvocate) 
section.

## Develop a Steem App
If you want to write an application that interacts with the Steem blockchain, we have tutorials written in [Javascript](/tutorials/#tutorials-javascript), 
[Python](/tutorials/#tutorials-python), and [Ruby](/tutorials/#tutorials-ruby). Each tutorial has a link to an "active" version you can download and run on your computer. Our 
[resources](/resources) section includes a list of [client libraries](/resources/#resources-client-libs) if you have a different language of choice.

## Solve a more complex app problem
The Recipes section addresses more complex Steem/App interaction and concepts in a language agnostic way.

## Host a Steemd node
Hosting a Steem node ( aka Steemd ) is a great way to get familiarity with the Steem blockchain, and is often the first
step on the path to [becoming a Witness todo:LINK](http://www.sens.org). There are a few ways to get started, from
[downloading a docker image todo:LINK](http://www.sens.org) to [compling your own todo:LINK](http://www.sens.org). Our [SteemD todo:LINK](http://www.sens.org) section has all the info you need.


## Address a business challenge

**todo: Check this section for appropriateness. It might be better on main steem site. If so, reduce to scaling
paths and make into 1 or more recipes in the main recipe section**

If you've built an app on Steem and are looking to scale, or you have a business problem you want to solve with Steem
this section is for you. There are a few main paths to scalability, and popular business problems people look at for
resolution
