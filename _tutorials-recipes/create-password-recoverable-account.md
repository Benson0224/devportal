*This recipe is to show how to create an account that is recoverable in the event of a hacked account or lost password*

This recipe is effectively an RFC. It only outlines part of the account creation process. It should not be considered complete, nor legal advice on best process for account creation.

## The 7 Rules of Steemit!

The first rule of Steemit is: Do not lose your password.
The second rule of Steemit is: Do not lose your password.
The third rule of Steemit is: We cannot recover your password.
The fourth rule: If you can remember the password, it's not secure.
The fifth rule: Use only randomly-generated passwords.
The sixth rule: Do not tell anyone your password.
The seventh rule: Always backup your password.

In order for you to recover your account, you need a password that was used previously. If you lost your password, nothing can be done to recover it.

#### Create a backup of your password and private keys

In order for a n account to be recovered, an old password is required. The whole process for recovery is set out in a [tutorial](https://github.com/steemit/devportal-tutorials-py/tree/master/tutorials/35_account_recovery) or direcly on [Steemit.com](https://steemit.com/recover_account_step_1). Without that password nothing can be done. If you lose your password, your account is lost and cannot be recovered.

For account security it is also advisable to change your password every month. There is a [tutorial](https://developers.steem.io/tutorials-python/password_key_change) that describes this process or you can run it directly from [Steemit.com](https://steemit.com/change_password). Since Steemit offers these functions through their webiste there is no need to work on the backend. If your account gets hijacked, you have up to 30 days to recover your account.

#### Account Recovery

If you created your account via Steemit.com and have your last known master password you can attempt to recover your account.
If however you created your account via SteemInvite.com or Anonsteem or any other third party services then they are your recovery agent. You need to go to your account registrar/recovery agent to recover your account.

If you are unsure you can view your recovery agent on [Steemd.com/@username](Steemd.com/@username)

#### Keep your funds safe

In addition to just having STEEM in your account, you can store liquid Steem tokens as Steem Power or hold your SBD/STEEM in 'savings' - both these features prevent rapid liquidation and transfer of asset and give you more time to recover your account without any loss of funds.
